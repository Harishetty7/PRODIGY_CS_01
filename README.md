Caesar Cipher
This is a simple GUI application built using Python and Tkinter to demonstrate the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm.This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting the characters in the message. The program is designed to be user-friendly, with prompts guiding the user through the encryption and decryption process.

Features
Encrypt text with a specified shift amount.
Decrypt text with the same shift amount.
Clear input and output fields.

Usage
Enter the text to be encrypted or decrypted in the "Text" field.
Specify the shift amount in the "Shift amount" field.
Select the mode (Encrypt or Decrypt) using the radio buttons.
Click the "Process" button to perform the encryption or decryption.
Click the "Clear" button to reset the input and output fields.
